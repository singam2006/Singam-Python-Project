📊 Business Financial Analysis using Python
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Financial Insights Extraction on a dataset containing business-related financial records. The analysis is supported by data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to aid in business decision-making.

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes financial information of businesses with fields such as:
industry
line_code
size (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)
level (numerical scale)
value (financial amount)

File: python project.csv
🧼 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values using appropriate strategies:
Mode for categorical columns (line_code, industry, size, description)
Mean for numerical columns (level, value)
Replaced special characters (e.g., \x96 to -)
Removed duplicate rows
Applied Z-Score for outlier detection and removed extreme values

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics
Visualized data distributions and counts using:
Histogram of financial value
Bar chart of industry counts

💡 3. Financial Insights Extraction
Key metrics calculated:
Total Value
Average Value
Maximum Value

📈 4. Data Visualizations

📊 Histogram – Distribution of financial values

🏭 Bar Chart – Count of records by industry

📌 Scatter Plot – Total value by industry

🧁 Pie Chart – Business size distribution

📦 Box Plot – Value by business size

📉 Line Graph – Level vs Value trend
